What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

What is Bitcoin Core Squared?

Bitcoin Core Squared is the name of open source software which enables the use of Bitcoin Core.
